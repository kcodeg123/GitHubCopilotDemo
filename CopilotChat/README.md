# GitHub Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot Chat brings Context to a conversation, which wasn't possible with only GitHub Copilot Code Completions with inline comments.

## 1. Make the codebase more readable

Let's review a poorly documented regex code. Instead of pulling up some regex documentation, let's see what copilot chat can do.

        import re
        
        e_regex = r'^[\w\.\+\-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+$'
        p_regex = r'^(\+)?1?\d{9,15}$'
        s_regex = r'^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$'
        
        def checkvalid(text, regex):
            if re.search(regex, text):
                return True
            else:
                return False
        
        if __name__	== '__main__':
            print(("valid", "invalid")[checkvalid('',e_regex)])
            print(("valid", "invalid")[checkvalid('',p_regex)])
            print(("valid", "invalid")[checkvalid('',s_regex)])

Now try these prompts

        Explain the selected regex code
        Make this code more readable
        Seperate out the validation functions and add more comments

Code is now in separate functions with comments and the variables now have much more meaningful names

## 2. Create entire classes just based on a dialog

Save the following data in a CSV file

        ï»¿David;47;Tacos
        Johan;32;Pizza
        Mia;38;Burgers
        Lena;26;Sushi

Select the data as the context, open up GitHub Copilot Chat and enter the following prompts:

* `I have a .csv file containing information in the following structure. Please help me setup a class in C# to handle CRUD operations for this file.`
* `I need this class to be very resilient. What can I do for that?`
* `Looks great, could you also help me to add logging? We usually log to the console in my project.`
